# Game-Player-Payment-Prediction
This is a data mining competition. We mainly focus on a game named Brutal Age. We aim to predict the consumption for the next 45 days based on the game data of the player within 7 days after registration. After data exploration and feature engineering, the lightGBM model was used to accurately predict the player's consumption. Finally, we ranked 31/1634 in the competition.
